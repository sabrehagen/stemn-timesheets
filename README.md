# stemn-timesheets
STEMN timesheets prompter is used to track the tasks you've been working on.

FP all the way yo.

NOTE: On first run there is no database, so you must create a new task.

monitor.sh depends on logkeys (available in apt-get for ubuntu)
put in crontab: xfce4-terminal -x sh -c "/home/jackson/repositories/timesheets/monitor.sh"
